PassingCarsA non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive cars on a road.

Array A contains only 0s and/or 1s:

0 represents a car traveling east,
1 represents a car traveling west.
The goal is to count passing cars. We say that a pair of cars (P, Q), where 0 ≤ P < Q < N, is passing when P is traveling to the east and Q is traveling to the west.

For example, consider array A such that:

A[0] = 0
A[1] = 1
A[2] = 0
A[3] = 1
A[4] = 1
We have five pairs of passing cars: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4).

Write a function:

def solution(A)

that, given a non-empty array A of N integers, returns the number of pairs of passing cars.

The function should return −1 if the number of pairs of passing cars exceeds 1,000,000,000.

For example, given:

A[0] = 0
A[1] = 1
A[2] = 0
A[3] = 1
A[4] = 1
the function should return 5, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer that can have one of the following values: 0, 1.

暴力法容易想到，但是太简单，算法复杂度高，肯定不会这么写。
用暴力法的时候我们发现当出现两个 0 的时候时期是无效遍历，这个时候浪费了计算
所以采用计数法，也有点像 lazy calculation，先计算像东的车，当遇到第一个向西的车时候才开始计算成对个数，也就是这个时候才开始真正的计算，采用这样的方法只需要一次遍历就可以过。
