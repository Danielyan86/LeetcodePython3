You are given two non-empty arrays A and B consisting of N integers. Arrays A and B represent N voracious fish in a river, ordered downstream along the flow of the river.

The fish are numbered from 0 to N − 1. If P and Q are two fish and P < Q, then fish P is initially upstream of fish Q. Initially, each fish has a unique position.

Fish number P is represented by A[P] and B[P]. Array A contains the sizes of the fish. All its elements are unique. Array B contains the directions of the fish. It contains only 0s and/or 1s, where:

0 represents a fish flowing upstream,
1 represents a fish flowing downstream.
If two fish move in opposite directions and there are no other (living) fish between them, they will eventually meet each other. Then only one fish can stay alive − the larger fish eats the smaller one. More precisely, we say that two fish P and Q meet each other when P < Q, B[P] = 1 and B[Q] = 0, and there are no living fish between them. After they meet:

If A[P] > A[Q] then P eats Q, and P will still be flowing downstream,
If A[Q] > A[P] then Q eats P, and Q will still be flowing upstream.
We assume that all the fish are flowing at the same speed. That is, fish moving in the same direction never meet. The goal is to calculate the number of fish that will stay alive.

For example, consider arrays A and B such that:

A[0] = 4 B[0] = 0
A[1] = 3 B[1] = 1
A[2] = 2 B[2] = 0
A[3] = 1 B[3] = 0
A[4] = 5 B[4] = 0
Initially all the fish are alive and all except fish number 1 are moving upstream. Fish number 1 meets fish number 2 and eats it, then it meets fish number 3 and eats it too. Finally, it meets fish number 4 and is eaten by it. The remaining two fish, number 0 and 4, never meet and therefore stay alive.

Write a function:

def solution(A, B)

that, given two non-empty arrays A and B consisting of N integers, returns the number of fish that will stay alive.

For example, given the arrays shown above, the function should return 2, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..1,000,000,000];
each element of array B is an integer that can have one of the following values: 0, 1;
the elements of A are all distinct.

这题目看着很简单，好像是括号匹配的那题的变体，其实不然。
首先，如果把上下两个方向鱼群比作是左右括号的话，会发现 stack 里面可以存左括号，也可以存右括号，这样还要加一个方向的判断作为标记，显然太复杂了。
正确的思路比较巧妙，不太容易想到，用 stack 存向下的鱼群，用一个变量存向上的鱼，最后的结果是 stack 的长度加上变量的和。
这个时候 stack 都是向下鱼，比较时候不用再加方向判断。

- 如果都是向下，则不会碰到向上鱼产生比较计算。
- 如果都是向上，stack 则一直为空，只需要把向上的计数器加一。
- 如果先来了向下的鱼则会记录在 stack 里面，如果碰到向上的鱼，则发生比较计算：
  - 如果向上鱼更小，则 stack 不变，进入下一轮迭代。
  - 如果向上鱼大，则 pop 出最后一个，进入下一轮迭代。
  - 如果 stack 被清空，则直接把向上鱼计数器加一。
