A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. A pair of integers (P, Q), such that 0 ≤ P < Q < N, is called a slice of array A (notice that the slice contains at least two elements). The average of a slice (P, Q) is the sum of A[P] + A[P + 1] + ... + A[Q] divided by the length of the slice. To be precise, the average equals (A[P] + A[P + 1] + ... + A[Q]) / (Q − P + 1).

For example, array A such that:

    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 2
    A[2] = 2
    A[3] = 5
    A[4] = 1
    A[5] = 5
    A[6] = 8

contains the following example slices:

slice (1, 2), whose average is (2 + 2) / 2 = 2;
slice (3, 4), whose average is (5 + 1) / 2 = 3;
slice (1, 4), whose average is (2 + 2 + 5 + 1) / 4 = 2.5.
The goal is to find the starting position of a slice whose average is minimal.

Write a function:

def solution(A)

that, given a non-empty array A consisting of N integers, returns the starting position of the slice with the minimal average. If there is more than one slice with a minimal average, you should return the smallest starting position of such a slice.

For example, given array A such that:

    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 2
    A[2] = 2
    A[3] = 5
    A[4] = 1
    A[5] = 5
    A[6] = 8

the function should return 1, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [2..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [−10,000..10,000].

# solution

这题依旧坑，考了一个数学知识，不清楚的话就不太好做。
就是最小平均数取决于临近的两个数字或者三个数字的平均数。
注意返回是 position，也就是下标，而不是最小平均数
注意需要减一，也就是两个数字时候取的是前一个。

```python3
def solution(A):
    # Implement your solution here
    min_ave=float('inf')
    min_idx=0

    for i in range(1,len(A)):
        if (A[i-1] + A[i])/2 < min_ave:
            min_ave = (A[i-1] + A[i])/2
            min_idx = i -1
        if  i < len(A) - 1:
            if (A[i-1] + A[i] + A[i+1]) < min_ave:
                min_ave = (A[i-1] + A[i] + A[i+1])/3
                min_idx = i -1
    return min_idx
```
