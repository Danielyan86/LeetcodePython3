An array A consisting of N different integers is given. The array contains integers in the range [1..(N + 1)], which means that exactly one element is missing.

Your goal is to find that missing element.

Write a function:

def solution(A)
that, given an array A, returns the value of the missing element.

For example, given array A such that:

A[0] = 2
A[1] = 3
A[2] = 1
A[3] = 5
the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
the elements of A are all distinct;
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..(N + 1)].

## solution

单次循环遍历大法比较容易想到，但是效率不太高,需要注意用 set 方法转化成集合，这个时候 if in 判断操作不是线性的，而是常数级别的

利用高斯求和公式(1+N+1)\*(N+1)/2 可以提高求和效率
注意处理边界值

so if we use the Gauss method to calculate the sum of consecutive numbers, the Gauss method is much more efficient than using Python's built-in sum() function, especially for large ranges of numbers.
