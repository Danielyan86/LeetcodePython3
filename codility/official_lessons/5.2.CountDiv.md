Write a function:

class Solution { public int solution(int A, int B, int K); }

that, given three integers A, B and K, returns the number of integers within the range [A..B] that are divisible by K, i.e.:

{ i : A ≤ i ≤ B, i mod K = 0 }

For example, for A = 6, B = 11 and K = 2, your function should return 3, because there are three numbers divisible by 2 within the range [6..11], namely 6, 8 and 10.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

A and B are integers within the range [0..2,000,000,000];
K is an integer within the range [1..2,000,000,000];
A ≤ B.

# solution

这题又是一个纯数学问题
第一反应用遍历法肯定不对，其实拆开看是两个简单问题，A 里面有多少个数可以整除 b，不就是 A/B 么？
然后变成一个区间有多少个数可以整除 B，假设整儿区间是 A1~A2，不就是 A2/B - A1/B
