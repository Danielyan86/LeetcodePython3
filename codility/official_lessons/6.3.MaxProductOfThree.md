A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The product of triplet (P, Q, R) equates to A[P] _ A[Q] _ A[R] (0 ≤ P < Q < R < N).

For example, array A such that:

A[0] = -3
A[1] = 1
A[2] = 2
A[3] = -2
A[4] = 5
A[5] = 6
contains the following example triplets:

(0, 1, 2), product is −3 _ 1 _ 2 = −6
(1, 2, 4), product is 1 _ 2 _ 5 = 10
(2, 4, 5), product is 2 _ 5 _ 6 = 60
Your goal is to find the maximal product of any triplet.

Write a function:

class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }

that, given a non-empty array A, returns the value of the maximal product of any triplet.

For example, given array A such that:

A[0] = -3
A[1] = 1
A[2] = 2
A[3] = -2
A[4] = 5
A[5] = 6
the function should return 60, as the product of triplet (2, 4, 5) is maximal.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [3..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000..1,000].

三数字乘积最大，由于有负数存在，不容易想到排序之后其实只有两种情况

- 三个整数，也就是最后三个最大数字相乘
- 负负得正，也就是前面吗两个最小负数相乘，再乘以最后一个最大正数
- 都是负数情况下同样成立
