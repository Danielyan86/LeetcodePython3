You are given N counters, initially set to 0, and you have two possible operations on them:

increase(X) − counter X is increased by 1,
max counter − all counters are set to the maximum value of any counter.
A non-empty array A of M integers is given. This array represents consecutive operations:

if A[K] = X, such that 1 ≤ X ≤ N, then operation K is increase(X),
if A[K] = N + 1 then operation K is max counter.
For example, given integer N = 5 and array A such that:

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 4
    A[2] = 4
    A[3] = 6
    A[4] = 1
    A[5] = 4
    A[6] = 4

the values of the counters after each consecutive operation will be:

    (0, 0, 1, 0, 0)
    (0, 0, 1, 1, 0)
    (0, 0, 1, 2, 0)
    (2, 2, 2, 2, 2)
    (3, 2, 2, 2, 2)
    (3, 2, 2, 3, 2)
    (3, 2, 2, 4, 2)

The goal is to calculate the value of every counter after all operations.

Write a function:

class Solution { public int[] solution(int N, int[] A); }

that, given an integer N and a non-empty array A consisting of M integers, returns a sequence of integers representing the values of the counters.

Result array should be returned as an array of integers.

For example, given:

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 4
    A[2] = 4
    A[3] = 6
    A[4] = 1
    A[5] = 4
    A[6] = 4

the function should return [3, 2, 2, 4, 2], as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N and M are integers within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..N + 1].

# solution

这题看似比较麻烦，其实这是 codility 的特色，把简单问题描述复杂化。其实核心就两个操作，

if A[K] = X, such that 1 ≤ X ≤ N, then operation K is increase(X),
if A[K] = N + 1 then operation K is max counter.

A[K] 看成一个标记操作的数组，依次遍历，
如果对应下标在数组范围内，则加 1
如果对应下标大大于了数组长度，也就是 N，则集体上涨到已经存在的最大值，普涨，一刀切
很容易想到用 max 方法取最大值然后再依次上涨，这样最大问题是提高了时间算法复杂度，

正确采用一个叫延迟加载方法，也就是把最后一次需要上涨的最大小值记录到一个变量，最后结束再统一更新
这里有个坑是由于采用了延迟加载有会出现两种情况，一种是是从未+1 的成员，则直达最后一次判断直接更新，没有问题
还有一种是中途被提升了一次，然后又需要+1 这种，这个时候需要先做一次判断，**要更新到上一次最小值**，再+1
when using the lazy counting method, there are more conditions need to cover

Another implicit condition in this problem is that the maximum count should fall between the highest number and the newly added counter, as each counter is incremented only once per operation.
